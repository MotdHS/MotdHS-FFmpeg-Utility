# MotdHS-FFmpeg-Utility
 
A tool written in Python to make using FFmpeg easier.

<h3>NOTE: This tool is still work in progress, and there might be some bugs.</h3>

## Features
- Change Bitrate, FPS, Resolution of a video
- Change Speed of a video

## How to run the program
- First, you need Python to run this program.

- Download and Install python at https://www.python.org/

- And make sure you check "Add Python 3.x to PATH"

- And now, open Command Prompt, and navigate to the folder.

- Type in `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- You will also need FFmpeg to use this program.

- Download FFmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html and put ffmpeg.exe in the program folder.

- After that, you can open the app by typing `python main.py`.

I tried to compile it into .exe with pyinstaller, but I couldn't get it to work for some reason.

I'll figure it out somehow soon, but for now, you need to do the steps above.
